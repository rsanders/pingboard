**** 0.5        Aug 19, 2008

Use new system.services API to discover information about services
supported by Ping.fm.

Allow the exclusion of certain services when posting -- click the 
service icon shown in the list, and that service (e.g., Twitter) will
be excluded from receiving the message.

Some Javascript library changes (not end-user visible):

 - actually use the Ajax queue to serialize requests if enabled

 - PingFMAPI is now an instantiable object (new PingFMAPI())

 - A rewrite function can be supplied to transform Ajax requests
   to e.g. use a proxy or have different arguments.  A sample
   rewriter is supplied: FlexProxyRewriter.  This can be useful when
   trying to use the Javascript library outside of dashboard, where
   the same-origin limitations prevent direct access to api.ping.fm.

**** 0.4.3      Aug 15, 2008

Added Rejaw service icon.

Small cosmetic tweaks.

**** 0.4.2      Aug 10, 2008

Show service icons on the main posting screen and message history.

Introduce a delay between a user.post/tpost and any requested user.latest
operations because of a race condition in Ping.FM's service.  (Will return
a blank list otherwise)

**** 0.4.1      Aug 8, 2008

Cosmetic tweaks to the message list.

**** 0.4        Aug 8, 2008

Allow posting directly to a specific service rather than a method or 
trigger.

Some UI tweaks.

**** 0.3.1      Aug 6, 2008

Show up to 25 of the user's last posts in a dropdown window.

**** 0.3        Aug 6, 2008

Save draft of currently composed post when scrolling back 
through history.

Save current post type in prefs; default to it until explicitly 
changed.

Use per-widget-instance prefs to allow for multiple instances 
in the dashboard.

Allow the first line of any post to be interpreted as the title
when using a blog-style post or trigger.  If there is only one line,
use a stock title.


**** 0.2        Aug 5, 2008

Post history - allows paging through "pings" posted
in this run of the widget, editing, and re-posting.  
(There is no persistence between runs/reboots.)

Added support for custom triggers.

Supply a fixed title for blog posts.

**** 0.1        Aug 4, 2008
